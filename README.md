# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `assignment 2`
* In the fullstackbloggerbackend (Server) repo: 
  * Install mongodb and dotenv ✅
    * npm i mongodb dotenv ✅
  * Create a new file ./.env ✅
  * Add your Mongo Atlas connection string to the .env file✅
    * MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<myusername>:<mypassword>@<mycluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    * Note: NoSqlBooster will still have your URI stored in the connections window. Click Connect -> Select export to URI.
  * Create a new file ./mongo.js and add the following code to it:✅
    * const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");✅
      require("dotenv").config();

      let db;

      async function mongoConnect() {
        const uri = process.env.MONGO_URI;
        const client = new MongoClient(uri);
        try {
          await client.connect();
          db = await client.db(process.env.MONGO_DATABASE);
          console.log("db connected");
        } catch (error) {
          console.error(error)
        }
      }
      function blogsDB() {
        return db;
      }
      module.exports = {
        mongoConnect,
        blogsDB,
      };
  * Add the following code, after the line var app = express();, to app.js:✅
    * var { mongoConnect } = require('./mongo.js');✅
      mongoConnect();✅
  * Add a new GET route "all-blogs" in ./routes/blogs.js
  * Implement the following functionality in the "all-blogs" route:
    * It should respond with a list of all the blogs currently stored in your blogs database as a JSON object 
      * res.send(allBlogs).
  
* In the fullstackbloggerfrontend (Client) repo:✅
  * Modify the useEffect method in the App component to be:✅
    * useEffect(() => {
      const fetchData = async () => {
        const url = `${urlEndpoint}/blogs/all-blogs`
        const apiResponse = await fetch(url);
        const apiJSON = await apiResponse.json();
        setServerJSON(apiJSON);
        return;
      };
      fetchData();
    }, []); 
  * Modify the BlogsPage component to be:✅
    * const BlogsPage = (props) => {
      return (
        <div className="blogs-page">
          <h1>Blogs Page</h1>
          <p>Server Message: {props.message.map((blog)=>{
            return (
              <>
                {blog.title}
              </>
            )
          })}</p>
        </div>
      )
    }
* Navigate to "localhost:3000/blogs"
  * It should display the titles of all the blogs in your database to the page.
* Stretch Goal: Display the other blog fields to the page along with title. Add css to improve the readability of the page.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
